	The following database project is a very unique one. Through Access we are able to make our own data and with a WPF application, make it come to life.
When the project is ran, there is a choice between two buttons, one for the Assets and one for the Employees. My two employees names are George Washington, and 
Thomas Jefferson each with unique employee ID's. When the Assets button is selected you will see the ID's of my employees along with their asset ID(What type of product
my employees sold that day) and also the description that explains the brand.
